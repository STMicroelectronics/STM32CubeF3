@par Example Description 
  This example shows how to configure the HRTIM to control a buck converter 
  with synchronous rectification.
  This is done using timer unit A and TA1/TA2 outputs (resp. PA8 and PA9).
  The duty cycle on TA1 is continuously varied in an interrupt service routine 
  generated on repetition event, to mimic a real converter management. 
  The FAULT1 input is enabled on PA12 (active low) to demonstrate PWM shut down 
  (low level sensitive), for both TA1 and TA2.
  When the fault is triggered (PA12 input connected to GND, TA1 and TA2 signals
  are shut-down. The system can be re-armed by pressing the user button.
  LEDs are indicating the following:
  Blue LED: blinks during normal operation
  Red LED: blinks when FAULT is triggered
  Orange LED: indicates the occurrence and duration of the PWM update ISR.

  The ADC is configured to have conversions triggered in the middle of the
  converter ON time, on PA1 (Vin) and PA3 (Vout) inputs.
  
  To run the demo, the Vin input of the BUCK-BOOST converter must be connected
  to the 5V_O supply. The resulting voltage is available on Vout pin.
  NB: to have the BOOST stage bypassed, the PA11 pin must be forced at 1 (to 
  have the T6 PMOS switched ON).
  

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F334x4/STM32F334x6/STM32F334x8 devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32F3348-DISCO
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.
  
  - STM32F3348-DISCO Set-up: PA12 must be briefly tied to ground to simulate a fault event

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
