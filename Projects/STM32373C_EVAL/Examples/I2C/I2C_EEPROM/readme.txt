      STM32373C-EVAL RevB

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK) to run at 72 MHz.

The I2C peripheral configuration is ensured by the HAL_I2C_Init() function.
This later is calling the HAL_I2C_MspInit()function which core is implementing
the configuration of the needed I2C resources according to the used hardware (CLOCK, 
GPIO, DMA and NVIC). You may update this function to change I2C configuration.

The I2C/EEPROM communication is then initiated.
The HAL_I2C_Mem_Read_DMA() and the HAL_I2C_Mem_Write_DMA() functions allow respectively 
the reception of Data from EEPROM and the transmission of a predefined data 
buffer.

For this example the TxBuffer is predefined and the aRxBuffer size is same as aTxBuffer.

In a first step the I2C writes the aTxBuffer by group of 128 bytes (EEPROM M24M01-HR
Page size) using HAL_I2C_Mem_Write_DMA() then read back the data through aRxBuffer
using HAL_I2C_Mem_Read_DMA(). 
The end of this two steps are monitored through the HAL_I2C_GetState() function
result.
Finally, aTxBuffer and aRxBuffer are compared through Buffercmp() in order to 
check buffers correctness.  

STM32 Eval board's LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:
 - LED1 is ON when the transmission process is complete.
 - LED2 is ON when the reception process is complete.
 - LED3 is ON when there is an error in transmission/reception process.  

@note I2Cx instance used and associated resources can be updated in "main.h"
file depending hardware configuration used.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F373xC devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32373C-EVAL RevB board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.    

  - STM32373C-EVAL RevB Set-up 
    - Make sure the jumper JP4 and JP5 are set in I2C_F position.
    - Make sure the jumper JP14 (E2P WC) is fitted on the board.
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
