@par Example Description 

This example describes how to use the TSC to perform an acquisition of two
channels in interrupt mode.

When the end of acquisition occurs, the acquired data are affected to the
uhTSCAcquisitionValue[] variable.

STM32 Eval board's LEDs are used as follows:
  - LED1, LED2 and LED3 show the touch activity for each channel.
  - LED4 toggles when an error occurs (TSC initialization, TSC start or assert).

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F373xC devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM32373C-EVAL board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
