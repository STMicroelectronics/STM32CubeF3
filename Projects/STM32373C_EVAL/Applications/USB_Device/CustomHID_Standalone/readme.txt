@par Example Description

Use of the USB device application based on the Custom HID Class.

This is a typical example on how to use the STM32F3xx USB Device peripheral, where the STM32 MCU is 
enumerated as a HID compliant device using the native PC Host HID driver to which the STM32373C-EVAL board
is connected.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset all the peripherals,
initialize the Flash interface and the systick. The user is provided with the SystemClock_Config()
function to configure the system clock (SYSCLK) to run at 72 MHz. The Full Speed (FS) USB module uses
internally a 48-MHz clock, which is generated from an integrated PLL. 
 
It is possible to remappe the USB interrupts (USB_LP and USB_WKUP) on interrupt lines 75 and 76.
User can select USB line Interrupt through macro defined in main.h. 
(USE_USB_INTERRUPT_DEFAULT and USE_USB_INTERRUPT_REMAPPED)

@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL configuration.

@note To reduce the example footprint, the toolchain dynamic allocation is replaced by a static allocation
      by returning the address of a pre-defined static buffer with the HID class structure size. 
	  
@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

To test the application, user must proceed as follows:
 - Start the "USB HID Demonstrator" PC applet and connect STM32 USB to PC
 - The device should be detected and shown in the USB HID target box
 - Press Graphic View button
 - Select "use SET_FEATURE" or "use SET_REPORT" in order to use SET_REPORT request to send HID Report
   for LED control
 - Use the potentiometer of the STM32373C-EVAL board to transfer the result of the converted voltage
  (via the ADC) the to the PC host (these values are sent to the PC using the endpoint1 IN)   
 - Make sure that following report ID are configured: LED1 ID (0x1), LED2 ID(0x2), LED3 ID(0x3),
   LED4 ID(0x4), BUTTON1_ID(0x5) and Potentiometer_ID(0x7).
 - Select LEDs to switch on/off on the STM32373C-EVAL board: a SET_REPORT request will be sent

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@note The build-in USB peripheral of the STM32F3x does not provide a specific interrupt for USB cable plug/unplug 
      detection. The correct way to detect the USB cable plug/unplug is to detect the availability of the VBUS line
	  using a normal GPIO pin (external interrupt line).

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F373xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32373C-EVAL
    evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - STM32373C-EVAL Rev B Set-up
    - Connect the STM32373C-EVAL board to the PC through 'USB Type A-Male 
      to A-Male.
              
@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
