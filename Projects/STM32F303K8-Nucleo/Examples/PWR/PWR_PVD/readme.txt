@par Example Description 
How to configure the programmable voltage detector by using an external interrupt 
line. External DC supply must be used to supply Vdd.

In this example, EXTI line 16 is configured to generate an interrupt on each rising
or falling edge of the PVD output signal (which indicates that the Vdd voltage is
moving below or above the PVD threshold). As long as the voltage is above the 
target threshold (2.5V), LED3 is blinking with a 200 ms-period; when the voltage drops
below the threshold, LED3 stops blinking and remains constantly on (or appears
to be turned off if the voltage is getting really low); when the voltage moves back
above the target threshold, LED3 starts blinking again.
If LED3 is slowly blinking (1 second-period), it means that the system has generated an error.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F303x8 devices
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32F303K8-Nucleo RevC
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device
    and development board.

  - STM32F303K8-Nucleo RevC Set-up :
    - After that the software is flashed :
       1°) Disconnect the usb cable.
       2°) Apply an adjustable power supply between Arduino VIN and GND.
           VIN is connected to VDD through a regulator.
       3°) Connect a voltmeter between Arduino 3V3 and GND to measure the voltage 
           effectively applied to VDD.
     - LED3 (GREEN) connected to PB.03 pin indicates the behaviour of
      the test software as explained above.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
