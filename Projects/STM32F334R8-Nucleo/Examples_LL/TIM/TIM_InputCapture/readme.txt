@par Example Description

This example shows how to use the TIM peripheral to measure the frequency of
a periodic signal provided either by an external signal generator or by
another timer instance; 
Example using the STM32F3xx TIM LL API, 
peripheral initialization done using LL unitary services functions
for optimization purpose (performance and size).
  
TIM1_CH1 is configured in input capture mode. The TIM1CLK frequency is set to 
its maximum value (Prescaler is /2 * 2 = 1) in order to get the best possible resolution.
So the TIM1 counter clock is SystemCoreClock.

SystemCoreClock is set to 64 MHz for STM32F3xx Devices.

The "uwMeasuredFrequency" variable contains the measured signal frequency.
It is calculated within the capture/compare 1 interrupt service routine.

The minimum frequency value to measure is TIM1 counter clock / TIMx_CCR1 MAX
                                              = 64 MHz / 65535

Due to TIM1_CC_IRQHandler processing time (around 1us), the maximum
frequency value to measure is around 1000kHz.

TIM2_CH1 is configured to generate a PWM signal.  User push-button can be used to
change the frequency of this signal from 2 kHz up to 20 kHz by steps of 2 kHz.
It is then possible to run this example without a signal generator by connecting
TIM2_CH1 to TIM1_CH1.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F334x8 devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32F334R8-Nucleo Rev C board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32F334R8-Nucleo Rev C Set-up
    - When no signal generator is used TIM2_CH1 can be connected to TIM1_CH1:
      - TIM1_CH1  PA.8: connected to pin 23 of CN10 connector  
      - TIM2_CH1  PA.05: connected to pin 11 of CN10 connector 

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
