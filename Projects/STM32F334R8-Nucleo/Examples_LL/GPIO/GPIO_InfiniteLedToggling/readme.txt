@par Example Description

This example describes how to configure and use GPIOs through the LL API to 
toggles the available users LEDs on the board each 250 ms. Peripheral initialization 
done using LL unitary services functions for optimization purpose (performance and size).


PA.05 IO (configured in output pushpull mode) toggles in a forever loop.
On STM32F334R8-Nucleo Rev C board this IO is connected to LED2.

In this example, HCLK is configured at 64 MHz.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F334R8 devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32F334R8-Nucleo Rev C board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
