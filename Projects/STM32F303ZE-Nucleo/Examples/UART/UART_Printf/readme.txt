@par Example Description 

Re-routing of the C library printf function to the UART.
The UART outputs a message on the HyperTerminal.

Board: STM32F303ZE-Nucleo Rev B
Tx Pin: PD.08
Rx Pin: PD.09

LED2 is ON when there is an error occurrence.

The USART is configured as follows:
    - BaudRate = 9600 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits (7 data bit + 1 parity bit)
    - One Stop Bit
    - Odd parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Reception and transmission are enabled in the time

@note USARTx/UARTx instance used and associated resources can be updated in "main.h"
file depending hardware configuration used.

@note When the parity is enabled, the computed parity is inserted at the MSB
position of the transmitted data.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F303xE devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32F303ZE-Nucleo Rev B board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.    

  - STM32F303ZE-Nucleo Rev B Set-up: 
    Connect ST-Link cable to the PC USB port to display data on the HyperTerminal. 
      A virtual COM port will then appear in the HyperTerminal. 
    @note Make sure that :
      SB5 is ON and SB6 is ON for USART3 communication between target and ST-Link (by default)

  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - Data Length = 7 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - Odd parity
    - BaudRate = 9600 baud
    - Flow control: None 

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
