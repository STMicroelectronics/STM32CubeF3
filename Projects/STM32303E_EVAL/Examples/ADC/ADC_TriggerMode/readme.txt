@par Example Description 

This example describes how to use the ADC and TIM2 to convert continuously data 
from ADC channel. Each time an external trigger is generated by TIM2 a new 
conversion is started by ADC.

At the end of conversion, an interrupt is generated and the converted data of 
ADC1 DR register is affected to the uhADCxConvertedValue variable in the ADC 
conversion complete call back function (HAL_ADC_ConvCpltCallback).

The timer is used to trigger an ADC measure at 20 KHz.

Configuration of the timer to trig an ADC measure at 20 Khz:
  From the reference manual, Reset and Clock control part, Timer 2 is clocked on PCLK1.
  The function SystemClock_Config() configures the clock divider as follows:
  1) The system clock is 72 MHz.
  2) AHB  Prescaler = 1 => AHB clock is 72 MHz.
  3) APB1 Prescaler = 2 => PCLK1 clock is 36 MHz.
  4) For Timer 2, as APB1 Prescaler = 2, Timer 2 Clock is PCLK1 clock X 2 = 72 Mhz.

  For a 20 Khz frequency, we need 72 MHz / 20 KHz = 3600 clock cycle.
  So, in TIM_Config function, we set the following period: htim.Init.Period = 3600;

The voltage on pin PC.01 (ADC_CHANNEL_7)can vary using the board potentiometer RV2.

Remark: LED3 is ON when there is an error in initialization.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F303xE devices.

  - This example has been tested with STM32303E-EVAL RevC board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
