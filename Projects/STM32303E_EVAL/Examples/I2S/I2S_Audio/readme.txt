@par Example Description 

Basic implementation of audio features. This example allows playing an audio 
file with an external codec on the STM32303E-EVAL board through the I2S 
peripheral using DMA transfer.

In this example the I2S input clock, provided by a dedicated PLL (PLLI2S),  is
configured to have an audio sampling frequency at 8 KHz with Master clock enabled.

This example uses an audio codec driver which consists of two independent layers:
 - Codec Hardware layer: which controls and communicates with the audio codec 
   (CS43L22) implemented on the evaluation board.
 - The high layer: which implements overall control and interfacing API allowing
   to perform basic audio operations (Init, Play, Pause, Resume, Stop, Volume 
   control and audio file pointer management)
  
In this example the audio file is stored in the internal flash memory (Mono, 
16-bit, 8 KHz). The analog output device is automatically detected (Speaker or 
Headphone) when the Headphone is plugged/unplugged in/from the audio jack of the 
evaluation board. The example also manages information display and control interface
through push buttons: 
 - When the application is Playing audio file:
     + Key push button: Pause
     + Joystick UP push button: Volume UP
     + Joystick DOWN: Volume DOWN
 - When the application is Paused:
     + Key push button: Play
     + Joystick UP push button: No action
     + Joystick DOWN: No action
This example plays the audio file stored in internal flash memory and replays it
when it reaches end of file. But it can be tailored to used different media storage
devices (SDCard (through SDIO), external Memory (through FSMC) ...) or to play 
in streaming mode (ie. from USB port in device or host mode). In this case, Circular
DMA mode should be preferred (by enabling the define DMA_CIRCULAR in
I2Sx_MspInit() API of stm32303e_eval_audio.c file).  

List of Known Limitations and more detailed user notes are provided in file 
stm32303e_eval_audio.c   (under Drivers\BSP\STM32303E-EVAL RevC)

The provided sample Audio file (stored in internal Flash memory) is extracted from:
  - Title: Partita E major, Gavotte en rondeau  
  - Artist/Composer: J.-S. Bach

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32F303xE devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32303E-EVAL RevC board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32303E-EVAL RevC Set-up
    - Make sure the jumper JP5 and JP6 are set in I2C2 position.

@par How to use it ? 

 - Use STLink utility, available on www.st.com or any other in system programming
   tool to load a ".wav" file to the STM32 internal flash at the address 0x0800A000.
   Make sure the audio file size does not exceed 512KB. When using STLink utility change
   the audio file extension to "*.bin" in order to be able to load it directly to flash memory.
   
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
         @note Make sure that the tool flash loader does not erase or overwrite the
            loaded audio file at address 0x0800A000 by limiting the application
            end address to 0x0807FFFF. This is already done for the example project 
 - Connect a headphone to the audio jack connector (CN11).
